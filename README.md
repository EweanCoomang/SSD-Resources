### About pull requests:
* I use `snake_case` rather than `camelCase` for variables, `ALLCAPS` for enum entries, and I capitalise all words in class names/functions like `MyClass`, please be consistent with this if making a PR
* "RTFR" - Read the fabulous README, please check your question/issue hasn't been answered/adressed in a README
### A few other notes:
* Some tasks may be missing, I didn't think these were relevant enough to be included
* This is still mostly complete despite the above!
* If you find anything to be missing, submit a PR with the missing material and some extra info on what it is so it may be added, thanks :)
